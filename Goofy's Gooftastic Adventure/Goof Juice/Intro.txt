Hyuck Sora, The worlds have been taken over by that golly gosh 
dang DARKNESS again, we've gotta do something about it!

Sadly Donald will not be able to come with us as he is currently 
using the toilet and we don't have time to wait.
(He's also taken over several worlds which is very not epic)

To save the worlds we have to find the juice stones FAST, 
as a result we don't have time to deal with the fact that this is a 
new Kingdom Hearts installment and you've forgotten everything again. 

Let's start the search!

(Also by the way there are five torn pages and I'd really appreciate 
if we could find them along the way so I can make a new pair of pants)
