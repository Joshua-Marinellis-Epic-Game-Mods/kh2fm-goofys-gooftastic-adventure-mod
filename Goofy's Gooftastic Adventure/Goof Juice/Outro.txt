Thanks for playing, it was really fun making this plando and I hope it was fun.

Thanks again to the wonderful people in the kh modding and rando community who
have helped make this possible, whether it be through playtesting, giving ideas
or teaching me how to do stuff I really appreciate it.

Also I think the ending music really captures the mood and essence of the game
your playing and the experiences you've had with it so I had to look around
to see if I could find something fitting for the emotional tale this plando 
contains.

Anyhow here's the song:
