Hello epic gamers, this is my first 
plando and I really hope it is a fun experience!


Setup-------------------------------------------------------------

This mod requires: 
*This version of the mod currently only works with the OpenKH Mod Manager*

pcsx2 1.6/pcsx2-ex (setup with bios installed)
A dumped copy of Kingdom Hearts 2

Please only play this mod with an legally obtained copy of both 
your ps2 bios and the game!

If you would like to learn how to legally setup pcsx2 1.6
including bios and game dumping here is my tutorial:

To install just chuck the .pnach files into your pcsx2 cheats folder
and enable cheats. This must be played with pcsx2 1.6 or pcsx2-ex

*Make sure to use the modified GoA provided, 
the GoA mod was originally made by SonicShadowSilver2*
Go check him out on Twitch, he's been working 
hard for partner and totally deserves it.

*Dodge slash is highly recommended but not required.*


Objective---------------------------------------------------------

Your goal is too find the goof stones
using the power of the goof juice.

Some worlds have been taken over by Donald, 
to enter you must leave Goofy and the power 
of the Goof Juice behind.


Softlocks/Important Notes-----------------------------------------

Make sure to i-frame through final xemnas's move 
"Can you spare a heart"
If you fail to do so your game will softlock 

You will eventually fight boat pete, if you let go of the hook you
will be softlocked, yes this is an intentional punishment
