Repository for the Goofy's Gooftastic Adventure Mod for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix

This mod was made as an educational project to learn about the inner workings of a complex video game.

The mod was made through memory editting and the in-game text changes are
achieved through an openkh patch containing a yml file with the text changes.

This mod does not redistribute any copyrighted assets from the original game outside of 
small values and IDs that are used to achieve the mods results.

Please only play this mod with a legally owned version of the game and PlayStation 2 Bios.
If you would like to learn how to legally dump the game and Playstation 2 BIOS
here is a tutorial I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdIMreAz_Tk
