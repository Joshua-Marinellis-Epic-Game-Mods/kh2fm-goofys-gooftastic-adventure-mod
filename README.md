I receive no form of monetary compensation for this game mod.

At the request of the rightful copyright holder this free mod will be taken down if so desired.

THIS IS THE NO FLASHING VERSION OF GOOFY'S GOOFTASTIC ADVENTURE.
THIS MEANS THERE ARE NO MODEL SWAPS IN THIS VERSION AS THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FLASHING.

Hello fellow epic gamers, this is my first
plando and I really hope it is a fun experience!

SETUP-------------------------------------------------------------------

To install just chuck the .pnach folders into your pcsx2 cheats folder
and enable cheats.

Make sure to install the OpenKH patch called "Goof Patch" in OpenKH for all of the cosmetic changes.

*Make sure to use the modified GoA provided, 
the GoA mod was originally made by SonicShadowSilver2*
Go check him out on Twitch.

DO NOT USE THE STANDARD GOA WITH THIS MOD

When run with Shananas's QoL patches it has crashed due to memory issues.
I dunno if it's caused by me or their patch but use at your own risk.

This mod requires the game to be run through the OpenKH Mod Manager.

Also make sure your using a version atleast as new at version 1.6,
some versions of 1.5 work as well but I don't know which do and
which don't.

GOAL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your goal is too find the five Juice stones
using the power of the goof juice.

Some worlds have been taken over by Donald, 
to enter you must leave Goofy and the power 
of the Goof Juice behind and turn to the Donald side.

Donald is also using their magic to mess with the portals!
You won't know which worlds you have completed from the portal's state.

*Dodge slash is highly recommended but not required.*

SOFTLOCKS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to limit through final xemnas's move 
"Can you spare a heart"
If you fail to do so your game will softlock 
which is totallllllly intentional, maybe safestate 
before then just in case.

If you let go of the timeless river Pete's 
hook you are totally softlocked so don't.

Make sure to be careful in stt, in many instances if you 
open a chest you won't be able to move and if you go valor form and 
jump you will be softlocked later on so uhhh don't do that.

If you somehow get to playing as rucksack don't jump.

In valor and in a unique situation in agrabah don't don't attempt to dodge roll or you might be softlocked.
